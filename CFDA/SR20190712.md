    *  Release Notes
        *  Grid:
            1.  Feature: Use micron distance to record the grid line position in grid log.
            2.  Bugfix: marker append FOV add boundary highlight.
            3.  Feature: Formal grid log, include fov, channel and many parameters.
            4.  Feature: None auto grid mode, use modified grid log as input, summit.grid will re-generate all output.
            5.  Feature: Raw image generate in secure directory and grid/channels/*/viewable_raw.
            6.  Feature: debug mode remake, thread supported log.
            7.  Feature: Marker append image from 2x9x(3x3) => 2x9x9.
            8.  Feature: Remove FOV image generate in grid/channels/*/viewable_norm, only preserve the stitched image.
            9.  Support M/pT marker type.
            10. Add grid log into channel directory.
            11. Bugfix: Avoid one task fail, abort all tasks in mutli-task mode. 
            12. Bugfix: Avoid ArUco detector crash.
            13. ArUco support grdding algorithm: grid location.
            14. ArUco support grdding algorithm: rotation estimation, micron to pixel compute.
            15. Better viewable image auto contrast adjustor.
            16. Light mean analysis add 3 row analysis.
            17. Bugfix: Avoid multi-task mode consume all memory and crash.
